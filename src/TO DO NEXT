TO DO NEXT

* Memory management

* Paging

* Threads
	* Threads are either user threads or kernel threads (for now we're just going to implement kernel threads)
	* Scheduler?

* Have a more reasonable input terminal
	* Better VGA text, input commands. 

* Scheduling? 
	* So we don't do too much in the interrupt calls?

* Create some sort of basic terminal command to run


TO DO FUTURE

* Properly separate out architecture dependent code.
